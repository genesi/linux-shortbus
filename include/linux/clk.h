/**
 * struct clk_ops -  Callback operations for clocks; these are to be provided
 * by the clock implementation, and will be called by drivers through the clk_*
 * API.
 *
 * @prepare:	Prepare the clock for enabling. This must not return until
 *		the clock is fully prepared, and it's safe to call clk_enable.
 *		This callback is intended to allow clock implementations to
 *		do any initialisation that may sleep. Called with
 *		clk->prepare_lock held.
 *
 * @unprepare:	Release the clock from its prepared state. This will typically
 *		undo any work done in the @prepare callback. Called with
 *		clk->prepare_lock held.
 *
 * @enable:	Enable the clock atomically. This must not return until the
 *		clock is generating a valid clock signal, usable by consumer
 *		devices. Called with clk->enable_lock held. This function
 *		must not sleep.
 *
 * @disable:	Disable the clock atomically. Called with clk->enable_lock held.
 *		This function must not sleep.
 *
 * @get:	Called by the core clock code when a device driver acquires a
 *		clock via clk_get(). Optional.
 *
 * @put:	Called by the core clock code when a devices driver releases a
 *		clock via clk_put(). Optional.
 *
 * The clk_enable/clk_disable and clk_prepare/clk_unprepare pairs allow
 * implementations to split any work between atomic (enable) and sleepable
 * (prepare) contexts.  If a clock requires sleeping code to be turned on, this
 * should be done in clk_prepare. Switching that will not sleep should be done
 * in clk_enable.
 *
 * Typically, drivers will call clk_prepare when a clock may be needed later
 * (eg. when a device is opened), and clk_enable when the clock is actually
 * required (eg. from an interrupt). Note that clk_prepare *must* have been
 * called before clk_enable.
 *
 * For other callbacks, see the corresponding clk_* functions. Parameters and
 * return values are passed directly from/to these API functions, or
 * -ENOSYS (or zero, in the case of clk_get_rate) is returned if the callback
 * is NULL, see drivers/clk/clk.c for implementation details. All are optional.
